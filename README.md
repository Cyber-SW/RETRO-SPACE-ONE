# RETRO-SPACE-ONE

After 4 intense weeks of learning JavaScript,
I put all my newly gained knowledge together and build RETRO-SPACE-ONE,
the first project I created during my time at the Ironhack Bootcamp
and the first real project on my journey to become a Web Developer.

TIME LIMIT: 6 days

TECH: P5.Js | JavaScript (ES6) | HTML5 | CSS3

CONTROLS: W = Up | S = Down | A = Left | D = Right | SPACE = Shoot

HINT: Before pressing start wait 3 seconds to guarantee all game assets has been fully loaded!

FEATURES:
The player can choose between 3 different ships each with different properties.
The goal is to get the highest possible score before dying.
The game difficulty increases over time.
2 different types of enemies with different rewards.

GAME STATUS: Currently there is a little bug that sometimes causes
the player to lose only half a life point instead of a whole life point.
Also, the big enemy death animations are sometimes choppy.
